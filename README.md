```
1. [en_te_wiki_titles](https://github.com/notAI-tech/Datasets/releases/download/En-Te_Transliteration/v1.en_te_wiki_titles.txt):

    contains 13,811 word en-te pairs, generated from Wikipedia by comparing titles of parallel articles.


2. [ni_bondha_comments](https://github.com/notAI-tech/Datasets/releases/download/En-Te_Transliteration/v1.ni_bondha_comment_words.txt):

    contains 24,757 word en-te pairs.
    
    The english versions of telugu words are obtained from the subreddit [r/Ni_Bondha](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ni_Bondha/).
    
    The corresponding telugu words are obtained by ranking transliterations of the subreddit comments from multiple models and APIs,
  using a [flair](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair) based character lm trained on Telugu text.
  
    Please note that english words are not lower-cased in this data. Since the english words are human written, we decided to retain the capitalization information in this release. Only punctuation was removed.
